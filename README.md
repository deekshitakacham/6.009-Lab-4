# 6.009-Problem-Set-4
In this lab, you will be working with freely available1 real-world mapping data to solve the realistic large problem of finding the shortest (or fastest) path between two points on a map. You will implement the backend for a route-finding application, which we will be able to use to plan paths around Cambridge.
